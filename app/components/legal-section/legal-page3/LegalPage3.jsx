      Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing
      period.
      <br /> <br />
      {`The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription
      that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some cases, your
      payment date may change, for example, if your Payment Method has not
      successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan, or if your
      paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. We may
      authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or
      service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it
      for one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for the
      Company's service using your account with a third party as a Payment
      Method, you can find the billing information about your membership by
