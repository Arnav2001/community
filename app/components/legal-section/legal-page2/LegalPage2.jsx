          way as set out in this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data
      and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our
      third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own
      purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified
      purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
      <br /><br />
      <div className="legal_page_h pb-2 pt-2 mb-[15px]">6. International Transfers</div>
      We share your personal data within the Company. This will involve
      transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We ensure
      your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to
      follow the same rules when processing your personal data.
      <br />
      <br /> Many of our external third parties are based outside the European
      Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve
      a transfer of data outside the EEA.
      <br />
      <br /> Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
      similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of
      the following safeguards is implemented:
      <br />
      <br />
      <ul className="ml-[40px] list-disc">
        <li>
          We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been
          deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by
          the European Commission.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts
          that give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them
          if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide
          similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br /> Please contact us if you want further information on the specific
      mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className="legal_page_h pb-2 pt-2 mb-[15px]">7. Data Security</div>
      We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
      personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
      unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to
      your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third
      parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your
      personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
      confidentiality.
      <br />
      <br /> We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
      data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach
      where we are legally required to do so.
      <br /><br />
      <div className="legal_page_h pb-2 pt-2 mb-[15px]">8. Data Retention</div>
      <div className="pb-2 pt-2">
        How Long Will You Use My Personal Data For?
      </div>
      We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil
      the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying
      any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
      <br />
      <br /> To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
      consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
      potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
      personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
      whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
      applicable legal requirements.
      <br />
      <br /> In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that
      it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical
      purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without
      further notice to you.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className="legal_page_h pb-2 pt-2 mb-[15px]">9. Your Legal Rights</div>
      Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in
      relation to your personal data. These include the following (see section
      10 â€“ Glossary below):
      <br></br>
      <br />

        us.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div className="pb-2 pt-2 text-[20px] mb-[15px]">No Fee Usually Required</div>
      You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
      exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee
      if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
      Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
      circumstances.
      <br /><br />
      <div className="pb-2 pt-2 text-[20px] mb-[15px]">What We May Need From You</div>
      We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
      your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
      exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
      that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
      receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in
      relation to your request to speed up our response.
      <br /><br />
      <div className="pb-2 pt-2 text-[20px] mb-[15px]">Time Limit to Respond</div>
      We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
      Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
      particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case,
      we will notify you and keep you updated.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className="legal_page_h pb-2 pt-2 mb-[15px]">10. Glossary</div>
      <div className="pb-2 pt-2 text-[20px] mb-[15px]">Lawful Basis</div>
      Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and
      managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product
      and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and
      balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your
      rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.
      We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are
      overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are
      otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further
      information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any
      potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting
      us.
      <br />
      <br /> Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is
      necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to
      take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
      <br />
      <br /> Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your
      personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or
      regulatory obligation that we are subject to.
